# Kx Alpha
Kx Alpha is an open source semi-modular kerbal space program controller project, that is currently under development. My main intention is to help others build their first controllers, and make building one cheaper to people that have the required tools and supplies, but don't want to waste their time on the process of making a controller for scratch.

The controller is adapted for mostly airplane or spaceplane use, but it is possible to use it for rockets.
